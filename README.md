This repository contains the code and resources I used during the **Automation Testing with LambdaTest** course on **LinkedIn Learning**. The course, which is **4 hours and 52 minutes** long, provided in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience with advanced test automation techniques using **LambdaTest** and **Selenium**. Throughout the course, I learned how to leverage cloud-based testing to run cross-browser and parallel tests, handle dynamic waits, capture failed screenshots, and more.

### **Course Overview:**

* **Platform:** LambdaTest (Cloud-based testing platform)
* **Course Duration:** 4 hours 52 minutes
* **Skills Learned:**

  * **Taking Failed Screenshots:** Capture detailed screenshots when tests fail to assist in debugging.
  * **Data Provider Configuration:** Setting up dynamic data-driven tests using a data provider.
  * **Dynamic Waits:** Implementing dynamic waits for elements, ensuring robust test execution in varying network conditions.
  * **Parameterized Testing:** Running the same tests with different sets of input data for more comprehensive coverage.
  * **Parallel Testing:** Speeding up the test execution by running tests in parallel on multiple browsers.
  * **Cross-Browser Testing:** Ensuring your application works seamlessly across different browser versions.
  * **Geolocation Testing:** Testing how your application behaves under different geographic conditions using geolocation features.
  * **Selenium Grid:** Setting up and using Selenium Grid on LambdaTest for scalable, cloud-based test execution.
  * **Selenium 4:** Working with the new features in Selenium 4 for improved test automation, including the WebDriver BiDi API and better browser interaction.

### **What You'll Find in This Repo:**

* **Sample Automation Scripts:** Code examples in **Java** or **Python** showcasing Selenium WebDriver in action.
* **Cross-Browser Test Configurations:** Code for running automated tests on different browsers via LambdaTest's cloud grid.
* **Geolocation Testing Examples:** Scripts to simulate different geographic locations for testing purposes.
* **Parameterization:** Example of data provider configuration and parameterized testing to handle multiple input sets.
* **Parallel Test Execution:** Configurations for running tests in parallel across different browsers.
* **Selenium Grid Setup:** Scripts for configuring Selenium Grid in the cloud environment.
* **Failed Screenshot Capture:** Code snippets showing how to capture screenshots when a test fails for better debugging.

### **Key Takeaways:**

* Mastered advanced automation testing techniques using **LambdaTest** and **Selenium**.
* Gained practical experience with **cross-browser** and **parallel testing** for faster and more reliable test execution.
* Implemented **dynamic waits** and **parameterized tests** to make tests more resilient and scalable.
* Learned how to integrate **geolocation** testing to simulate various real-world user conditions.
* Worked with **Selenium 4** to take advantage of its latest features for better browser automation.

This repository serves as a personal reference to the automation skills Iâ€™ve learned through the course and will be continuously updated with new projects and test configurations. It also demonstrates my ability to work with cloud-based testing tools and implement industry-standard test automation practices.
